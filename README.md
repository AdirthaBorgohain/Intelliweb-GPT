# Intelliweb-GPT

Intelliweb-GPT is an intelligent search engine / Question Answering module that uses GPT technology to provide accurate
and relevant answers to user queries. The search engine can search multiple sources, including Google News and Google
Web, to generate answers, and can also directly answer general user queries using GPT's existing knowledge. With GPT
connected to the internet, it's basically GPT on steroids!

## Features ðŸš€

Intelliweb-GPT provides the following features:

- Multi-source search: The module can connect to the internet and can search Google News and Google Web to generate
  answers for user queries.
- Direct answer generation: Intelliweb-GPT can directly answer general user queries using GPT's existing knowledge.
- Intelligent decision-making: The module breaks down the user query to intelligently decide whether to use GPT's
  existing knowledge or external sources to generate answers.
- Easy-to-use API: Intelliweb-GPT provides a simple API that developers can use to integrate the search engine into
  their own applications.

[//]: # (## Installation ðŸ”­)

[//]: # ()

[//]: # (You can install Intelliweb-GPT via pip:)

[//]: # ()

[//]: # (```shell)

[//]: # (pip install intelliweb_GPT)

[//]: # ()

[//]: # (```)

## Example Usage ðŸ’»

First install all libraries and modules mentioned in requirements.txt:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In the `.env` file, replace the `OPENAI_API_KEY` ENV variable's value with your own OpenAI API key.

Also, if you want to use serper API to fetch the relevant articles from the web, get your own API key
from [here](https://serper.dev/)
and add your API key to the `SERPER_API_KEY` env variable. While calling the `generate_answer` method, set
the `use_serper_api` argument to `True`.

Next, here's a simple example of how you can use Intelliweb-GPT:

```python
from pprint import pprint
from intelliweb_GPT import generate_answer

query = "How did the Super Mario Bros. movie fare at the box office?"
answer_dict = generate_answer(query, use_serper_api=False)

pprint(answer_dict)
```

Output:

```bash
{'answer': 'The Super Mario Bros. movie has been a massive success at the box '
           'office, breaking multiple records and becoming the '
           'highest-grossing video game adaptation of all time, surpassing '
           'Detective Pikachu. As of 2023-04-15, the film grossed $204.6 '
           'million domestically and $377 million globally in its opening '
           'weekend, and has since surpassed $500 million worldwide. It has '
           'become the biggest opening of 2023, the highest-grossing debut  '
           'for Illumination, and the second-biggest debut ever for an '
           'animated movie. The movie has already made more than 2.5 times its '
           'budget, which is generally what a movie needs to break even. '
           "There's a strong chance that the video game movie could join the "
           'billion-dollar club despite the bad reviews. However, it remains '
           'to be seen how well it will do in the following weeks.',
